# Adobe Connect Offline

Adobe Connect Offline is a tool for downloading and merging zip files containing video streams. It
uses [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) to process and merge the streams into a single output video file.

## Requirements

- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/download/) or [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/command-line.html)

## Installation

To use Adobe Connect Offline, you will need to install FFmpeg. You can find installation
instructions [here](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html). Once FFmpeg is installed, you can clone or download the
source code from this repository and build it using your preferred Java or Kotlin compiler.

## Usage

To use Adobe Connect Offline, you will need to provide the URL of the zip file containing the video streams you want to
download and merge. You can then specify an output path for the resulting video file. Adobe Connect Offline will handle
the rest!
